# GNN-FHE-Pipeline
This directory contains the code for my Final Year Project, where privacy-preserving Fully Homomorphic Encryption over the Torus (TFHE) is applied to a Graph Neural Network (GNN) model using Concrete-ML, specifically, the [GIN](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.00826) model. 

The GNN code is a modified version of the [IBM/Multi-GNN](https://github.com/IBM/Multi-GNN) repository. You can refer to my previous repository at [fabecode/GNN-FHE](https://github.com/fabecode/GNN-FHE) to view the initial commits, additions, and modifications made to the code before migrating it here. 

## Setup
To use the repository, you first need to install the conda environment via 
```
conda env create -f env.yml python=3.9
```
Note that concrete-ml requires torch 1.13.1 to work.

Then, the data needed for the experiments can be found on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ealtman2019/ibm-transactions-for-anti-money-laundering-aml/data). To use this data with the provided training scripts, you first need to perform a pre-processing step:
```
python format_kaggle_files.py '/path/to/kaggle-file/' '/path/to/output-file/'
```
Make sure to change the filepath at the beginning of the `data_loading.py` file to wherever you stored your formatted csv file generated by the pre-processing step.


## Usage
To run the experiments you need to run the `main.py` function and specify any arguments you want to use. There are two required arguments, namely `--data` and `--model`. 

For the `--data` argument, specify the file name, e.g `--data Small_HI`. The `--model` parameter should be set to any of the model classed that are available, i.e. to one of `--model [gin, gin_fhe gat, rgcn, pna]`. 
Thus, to run a standard GNN, you need to run, e.g.:
```
python main.py --data HI-Small_Formatted --model gin
```
To run a GNN on FHE, add the --fhe argument, e.g.:
```
python main.py --data HI-Small_Formatted --model gin_fhe --fhe
```

Then you can add different adaptations to the models by selecting the respective arguments from:

<div align="center">

| Column 1       | Column 2                     |
| -------------- | ---------------------------- |
| `--emlps`      | Edge updates via MLPs        |
| `--reverse_mp` | Reverse Message Passing      |
| `--ego`        | Ego ID's to the center nodes |
| `--ports`      | Port Numberings for edges    |

</div>
Thus, to run Multi-GIN with edge updates, you would run the following command:

```
python main.py --data Small_HI --model gin --emlps --reverse_mp --ego --ports
```
